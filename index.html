          <p> Elements consisting of tags enclosed in position brackets denote HTML. These elements apply as the structure blocks for every website built. HTML allows for descriptions and entrenchment of items and application when creating association forms. It also offers the means to generate ordered credentials through indicating structural semantics for text in the form of headings, paragraphs, lists and associations, among others.Delivery of HTML documents applies means similar to those used by other computer files. In some instances, delivery happens through hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP). An HTML element refers to all items between the start and end tags. The universal form of HTML elements is in a pair of tags consisting of a start tag and an end tag.Interpretation of HTML by web browsers into structured data does not constitute a programming language. The key feature of a programming language is the presence of functional roles.</p>

         <div class="col-xs-12" class="visible-xs"><h2>CSS</h2><br>
          <p> Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simply designed language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable. CSS allows you to apply styles to web pages. More importantly, CSS enables you to do this independent of the HTML that makes up each web page.CSS is easy to learn and understood but it provides powerful control over the presentation of an HTML document.CSS saves time : You can write CSS once and reuse same sheet in multiple HTML pages.Easy Maintainence : To make a global change simply change the style, and all elements in all the webpages will be updated automatically.Search Engines : CSS is considered as clean coding technique, which means search engines won’t have to struggle to “read” its content.Superior styles to HTML : CSS has a much wider array of attributes than HTML, so you can give a far better look to your HTML page in comparison to HTML attributes.</p>

         <div class="col-xs-12" class="visible-xs"><h2>JAVASCRIPT</h2><br>
          <P> JavaScript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is lightweight and most commonly used as a part of web pages, whose implementations allow client-side script to interact with the user and make dynamic pages. It is an interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities.JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.JavaScript is what is called a Client-side Scripting Language. That means that it is a computer programming language that runs inside an Internet browser (a browser is also known as a Web client because it connects to a Web server to download pages). The way JavaScript works is interesting.</P>
